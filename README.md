# Login and SignUp with OTP

A Flutter application that allows users to sign up, log in, and verify their identity using a One-Time Password (OTP). This app demonstrates a clean and intuitive user flow for authentication, including email/password-based sign-up/login and OTP verification.

## Features
- Sign-Up: Users can create a new account by providing their email and password.
- Login: Existing users can log in using their email and password. 
- OTP Verifaction: After signing up, users receive a 6-digit OTP to verify their email or phone number. 
- Sleek UI: Modern and responsive design with smooth animations.
- Multi-Screen Flow: Seamless navigation between Sign-Up, Login, and OTP Verification screens.
